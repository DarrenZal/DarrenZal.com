          My research investigates the intersection of computing, human-system
          interfaces, and emancipatory politics. I am interested in the
          potential of computing as a medium for thought, as a tool for
          collective action, and as a means of emancipation.

          My current focus is basic research into the nature of digital
          organisation, developing theoretical toolkits to improve shared
          infrastructure, and applying this research to the design of new
          systems and protocols which support the self-organisation of knowledge
          and computational artifacts.
