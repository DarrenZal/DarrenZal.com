title: Exploring Protocols for Regenerative Global Civilization
date: 2024-08-01

Welcome! This [[KnowledgeGarden|knowledge garden]] explores the interconnectedness of decentralized technologies, collective intelligence, and regenerative practices. It delves into how we might build more resilient, adaptive, and equitable social, ecological, and economic systems capable of addressing the [metacrisis](metacrisis.md).

The core theme is the shift [From Separation to Connection](FromSeperationToConnection.md)â€”moving from siloed, centralized structures towards networked, relational approaches inspired by natural systems like mycelial networks. This involves rethinking how we manage knowledge, coordinate action, and steward resources.

## Key Themes & Explorations

This site weaves together several threads, examining the tools, concepts, and philosophies needed for a regenerative transition:

**1. Networked Knowledge & Sensemaking:**
   - **[Knowledge Graphs](KnowledgeGraph.md) & [Relational Data](FromSeperationToConnection.md):** Moving beyond tables to represent knowledge through connections and context.
   - **[Semantic Density](SemanticDensityPrinciple.md):** Why graph-based systems offer more efficient knowledge representation, crucial for AI and decentralized networks.
   - **[Discourse Graphs](DiscourseGraphs.md):** Mapping conversations and arguments to build shared understanding in [Civic Knowledge Commons](DiscourseGraphs.md) and [Decentralized Science (DeSci)](GraphsForDeSci.md).
   - **[Knowledge Commons](KnowledgeCommons.md):** Principles and practices for collectively stewarding shared knowledge resources (see also [Sources](KnowledgeCommonsSources.md)).

**2. Decentralized Coordination & Governance:**
   - **[Open Protocols](OpenProtocols.md):** Foundational rules for interoperable, democratic digital infrastructure, moving beyond centralized platforms.
   - **[Decentralized Science (DeSci)](GraphsForDeSci.md):** Transforming research through open collaboration, funding, and knowledge sharing using graph structures.

**3. Regenerative Systems & Place-Based Action:**
   - **[Cosmo-localism](cosmolocalism.md):** Integrating global knowledge commons with resilient local production ("what is heavy is local, what is light is global").
   - **[Bioregionalism](BioregionURI.md):** Using natural boundaries (like watersheds) as a basis for ecological stewardship and governance, often supported by a [[BioregionalKnowledgeCommonsSummary|Bioregional Knowledge Commons]] and enabled by standardized identifiers like the proposed [Bioregion URI](BioregionURI.md).
   - **[Percolation Finance](PercolationFunding.md):** Innovative funding models inspired by physics to identify critical leverage points for systemic impact, often visualized through knowledge graphs.

**4. Foundational Principles:**
   - **[Semantic Density & Mycelial Networks](SemanticDensityPrinciple.md):** Drawing inspiration from nature's distributed intelligence for designing resilient information systems.
   - **[Relationality](FromSeperationToConnection.md):** Embracing interconnectedness as a core principle for technology, culture, and ecology.

These explorations aim to contribute to the development of practical tools and conceptual frameworks for navigating our complex global challenges and co-creating a more thriving future.

## About This Site

This site itself embodies many of the principles it explores - it's built as a living [[KnowledgeGarden|knowledge garden]] and graph using decentralized, open-source tools for content creation, publishing, and collaboration. The [architecture of this site](siteDesign.md) demonstrates in practice how discourse graphs and decentralized knowledge networks can be implemented, serving as both a working example and a template for similar projects.
