Open protocols are openly documented guidelines that anyone can use, implement, and modify (see [[SemanticDensityPrinciple|Semantic Density Principle]] for how effective documentation aids this). Developed collaboratively among multiple stakeholders, they are critical in transitioning from traditional top down institutions to decentralized bottoms up networks. They embody principles of non-rivalry, non-enclosability, self-determination, stigmergy, and composability. Unlike centralized platforms controlled by single entities, protocols enable a more democratic and innovative internet where multiple implementations can compete to provide better services while maintaining interoperability. The key advantage of protocols is that they push power and decision-making to the edges of the network rather than concentrating it in a few powerful platforms<sup>[1]</sup>.

Historical examples include foundational internet protocols like SMTP for email, IRC for chat, and HTTP for the web - all of which enabled diverse clients and services to flourish without central control<sup>[1]</sup>. While protocols historically faced monetization challenges compared to platforms, new models including token economics may make sustainable protocol development more viable<sup>[1]</sup>. 

Protocols serve both operational and technological functions. Operationally, they act as language structures for collaborative workflows (e.g., documented in [[DiscourseGraphs|Discourse Graphs]]) and provide computational law substantiation of policies. Technologically, they serve as computational syntax within which operations can be generated and formalized through algorithms, smart contracts, and legal processes<sup>[2]</sup>. In civic contexts, protocols are particularly important as they enable asynchronous (across-time) and remote (across-space) collaboration, while also reflecting synchronized and locally present collaborative behaviors. They provide essential processes for synergistic alignment of organizations around shared objectives<sup>[2]</sup>.

From a democratic and rights-based perspective, open protocols serve as foundational infrastructure that enables fundamental societal freedoms and rights in the digital age. Just as traditional rights create the possibility space for democratic action, protocols create the possibility space for digital interactions and applications. The early internet pioneers, particularly JCR Licklider, envisioned a much wider range of fundamental protocols as being necessary for a networked society than what has been implemented so far<sup>[3]</sup>.

Currently, many essential digital affordances lack widely adopted, non-proprietary protocols - including identification, group formation/communication, payments, and secure sharing of computational resources. This gap has led to these critical functions being controlled primarily by nation-states or private corporations rather than being available as public infrastructure. Recent initiatives like web3, decentralized web ecosystems, digital public infrastructure projects, and efforts to build shared knowledge systems like [[BioregionalKnowledgeCommons|Bioregional Knowledge Commons]] are attempting to address these missing protocol layers, though these efforts remain fragmented and underfunded<sup>[3]</sup>.

The development of open protocols requires careful consideration of their dynamic nature - they must be able to adapt to new uses and potential abuses while maintaining their core principles. This is particularly important as digital environments create new challenges for traditional rights like free speech, where information abundance rather than scarcity has become a key concern<sup>[3]</sup>.
